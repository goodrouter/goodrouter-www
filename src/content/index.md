# Intro

Goodrouter is a router implemented in two languages, TypeScript and Rust. The router is simple and supports parsing and formatting of routes. It can be used in any environment, in a client or server. The router uses a trie-ish data structure that makes the router scalable and fast.

It's a good router!
